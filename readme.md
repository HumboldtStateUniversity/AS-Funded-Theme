theme name __astemplate__

__Social media__
Icons for facebook, flickr, twitter, and youtube are in the img folder within the theme.

__Extra .tpl files__
If you're not planning on importing views for Announcements and Events, trash the following two files.
* views-view-fields--events.tpl.php
* views-view-unformatted--announcements.tpl.php

__Announcements & Events__
view to import and content type fields are in supplemental.txt

__Color changes in scss__
Colors variables are in the beginning of the scss file. The navarrow.png image needs a manual color change. Perhaps navarrow.png will be part of the css someday.
